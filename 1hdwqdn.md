When you place your order, the total purchase amount (including any shipping and handling costs, plus applicable taxes) will be charged to your card and deducted from your available credit. If your purchase includes a recurring subscription, then the first monthâ€™s subscription fee (but not any subsequent monthly subscription fees) will be included in the promotional purchase balance. Equal Pay promotions are not available all the time, may be limited to specific merchandise, and may have specific purchase requirements as disclosed in the offer during checkout. Equal Pay promotions are not available on purchases of less than $50 and the availability of one or more of these promotions on purchases is at Amazonâ€™s sole discretion. If you choose an Equal Pay 0% promo APR offer but do not pay the full amount of your promotional balance when due at the end of the applicable promotional period, any remaining amount after the promotion period ends will accrue interest at your standard Purchase APR as set forth in the Interest Charges section of your statement or in the Rates and Fees Table of your Cardmember Agreement.

The "6-month Equal Pay" offer is a financing option available to Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Cardholders for purchases over $50. By selecting this option during checkout, you agree to pay equal monthly installments over six months with a 0% promotional annual percentage rate (APR). This means you will not accrue any interest on your purchase during the promotional period, as long as you make the equal payments on time each month.

It's important to note that purchases made using the Equal Pay option do not qualify for % back rewards. The total purchase amount, including shipping, handling, and taxes, will be charged to your card and deducted from your available credit.

Equal Pay promotions are not always available and may be limited to specific items or have additional requirements. They are not applicable to purchases under $50, and the availability of such promotions is at Amazon's discretion. If your purchase includes a recurring subscription, the first month's subscription fee will be part of the promotional balance, but subsequent monthly fees will not be included.

While the entire purchase amount is charged to your card initially, the point of the 6-month Equal Pay offer is to make the payment process more manageable by allowing you to pay off your purchase in equal monthly installments without accruing interest during the promotional period.

This financing option can be helpful for those who would like to spread out the cost of their purchase over a longer period without having to pay extra due to interest charges. It provides an interest-free financing solution that enables you to make a more significant purchase without needing to pay the entire amount upfront.

Keep in mind that if you don't pay off the entire promotional balance by the end of the 6-month promotional period, any remaining balance will start accruing interest at your standard Purchase APR. To avoid paying interest, make sure to pay off the balance within the promotional period.
